-- The first property; When provided with the list and the tailed list we must not have a permutation by defintion
-- because tailing the list changes the length to n-1 and removes the first element and thus does not have the same elements

-- We test the property's on integer list, if we test on it it should work with any type because of parametricity

-- Questions
-- Q: Next, define some testable properties for this function, and use a number of well-chosen lists to test isPermutation. You may assume that your input lists do not contain duplicates. What does this mean for your testing procedure?
