-- ioco = any output i has been foreseen by m, i can be an IOTS (that is, always input enabled) and m is an LTS 
-- where always input-enabled means:
-- emtpy self loop = all input states, we dont have to loop a input state if already a q -> q'

--
-- i ioco-conforms to m, iff
-- if i produces output x after trace σ,
--then m can produce x after σ
-- if i cannot produce any output after trace σ,
--then m cannot produce any output after σ

-- i ioco m = def (forall Straces s : out(i after s) subset of out(m after s))

-- out(s) = the output labels from state s 
-- "delta" when taking a self-loop

-- Important difference between quiescent and ∅:
-- we get ∅ as the output when the we have out(∅)
-- we get quiescent output when we have no output states
